This is the user documentation of JRune. It is intended to provide you with
documentation and guidance for the game engine. The documentation follows a
simple structure to help you find the information you require.

The first section you should look into is the [Overview](Overview.html)
because it - as its name implies - gives you a quick introduction about what
the engine covers and how it is structured and basically how it works.

When you want to get real you should take a look at the 
[Getting started](Getting_started/index.html) section. Therein you will
find some information about technical requirements and how to get and
install the engine for your project.

A more detailed look at the different subsystems of the engine is provided
with the [Subsystems](Subsystems/index.html) part. Each subsystem is
explained in detail. The different subsections are also elaborated on with
example of the different features.

Finally the [Tutorials](Tutorials/index.html) give you some more insights
by showing more complex show cases while implementing games of different
complexity.
